# Beginning with JavaScript
JavaScript came about as a joint effort between Netscape Communications Corporation and
Sun Microsystems, Inc. The news release of the new language came on December 4, 1995,
back when Netscape Navigator 2.0 was still in its beta version. JavaScript version 1.0 became
available with the new browser. (Before its release as JavaScript, it was called LiveScript.)
JavaScript is an object-based, client-side scripting language that you can use to make Web
pages are more dynamic. To make sense of such a definition, let’s look at its important parts one by one.

## Object Based
Object based means that JavaScript can use items called objects. However, the objects are not
class based (meaning no distinction is made between a class and an instance); instead, they are just general objects. You’ll learn how to work with JavaScript objects in Chapter 8. You don’t
need to understand them in any detail until you know a few other features of the language.

## Client Side
Client side means that JavaScript runs in the client (software) that the viewer is using, rather than on the Web server of the site serving the page. In this case, the client would be a Web browser. To make more sense of this, let’s take a look at how a server-side language works and how a client-side language works.

    document.write("This writes text to the page");
